EIGRP: Enhanced Interiror Gateway Routing Protocol
======================================================
Eigrp is also called the advanced distance vector routing protocols, Cisco refers an  EIGRP as simply advanced distance
vector routing protocols.
Eigrp is the Cisco-proprietary routing protocols, but from 2013, Ciso defined the EIGRP as an open standard protocols.
Open standard enables the EIGRP to run on other Vendors routers as well.

Neighbors Discover
----------------------
To Discover the EIGRP neighbors, EIGRP sends the hello message via multicast address *224.0.0.10* to its neighbors
routers.
**HELLO** message is sent by the EIGRP routers to discover the neighboring EIGRP routers and check the basic parameters
to determine which router should be neighbor router. if those basic parameters cannot passed, the eigrp neighbors
discovery get failed.we will discuss more about neighbors discovery in latter chapters.

Topology Exchange
--------------------
After peering with the neighbour, the EIGRP router initially exchange the entire topology table with the neighbour
routers, and then only partial updates as needed based on the changes to the network topology


Choosing the Best route
---------------------------
Each EIGRP router analyzed their topology table and choose the route having lowest metric to the destination networks /
subnet

EIGRP Tables
---------------
Upon completing the above three step process `Neighbour Discover`_  `Topology Exchange`_ `Choosing the Best route`_  the
Eigrp router maintains the three different types of  tables called.

#. `EIGRP Neighbors Table`_

#. `EIGRP Topology Table`_

#. `EIGRP Routing Table`_

EIGRP Neighbors Table
-----------------------
* It is simply another routers which is running the EIGRP routing algorithm, within the common subnet. 

* **EIGRP HELLO** messages, sent to multicast IP address 2240.0.10 to dynamically discover the potential neighbors. 

* The routers must pass the some parameters before becoming the EIGRP neighbors.
 
  * It must pass the *Authentication* process
 
  * It must use the same AS (Autonomous Number)

  * The source IP address used by the neighbor Hello must be in the same subnet

.. note:: The routerâ€™s EIGRP K values must also match, this topic is beyond of CCNA 200-120 Version 2 course 

* After completing the EIGRP neighbors Verificaton method, **EIGRP** routers becomes the neighbors and they began to
* exchange their topology tables.
* we can simply issue the command show ip eigrp neighbors to view the EIGRP neighbors tables from global configuration mode.   

.. code:: R1(config)# show eigrp neighbors


EIGRP Topology Table
---------------------
* To Exchange the topology Table **EIGRP** use the *EIGRP update* message to its neighbors.

* Topology tables are exchanged using the *RTP* called as Reliable Transport Protocol

* Topology tables are updates using two methods
  * full routing updates
  * Partial routing updates

`full routing updates`_
***********************
In full routing updates, the eigrp routers exchange the entire routing tables with its neighbors, Full routing update
occours when the neighbors first come up.

`partial routing updates`_
*******************************
In Partial routing updates, the eigrp routers exchange only the recently changed routes.

Eigrp routing Table
---------------------
Every routing algorithm routing table stores the best route to the destination


Metric Calculation by the EIGRP
-----------------------------------
* Metric is the value used by the routing protocols to choose the best route.
* EIGRP use the Composite Metric to calculate the best path to its destination.
* EIGRP Composite Metric is the function of bandwidht and delay by default.
* Sometimes calculaton of metric is also depends upon the routers interface **load** and  **reliability**
* Some books say, MTU is also used for the Metric calculation, but EIGRP use, bandwidth and delay as the default parameters to choose the best route to the destination.
