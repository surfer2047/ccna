The TCP/IP and OSI Networking Models
=====================================

Operation of IP Data Networks
------------------------------------

TCP/IP Networking Model
----------------------------
* Networking Model is also called the networking architecure or sometimes networking **blueprint**
* These Models use the set of Logical rules called **protocols** 
* TCP/IP left hand side TCP/IP protocol stack is defined by *RFC 1122* documets

TCP/IP Application Layer
**************************
* Provides the User Interface
* It defines the services that applications need
* Defines whether the partner is ready or not to accept the data
* Define whether the Communication Medium is busy or not.

Protocols runs at the Applications layers are
**HTTP, DHCP, DNS, HTTPS, FTP, SMTP, TELNET, SSH** and many more.

TCP/IP Transport Layer
****************************
* Define the two protocols
* TCP: Transmission Control Protocols
* UDP: User Datagram Protocol
* TCP is responisble for the Connection oriented Communication, while UDP is responsible for the Connection less Communication.
* Transport layer Provides the services to the Application layer i.e. *n* layer provide services to *n+1* layer

TCP/IP Network Layer
***************************
* It is responsible for addressing and routing of the packets
* *IP* is the protocol defined as the Network Layer.
* Network Layer is responsible for the *Internetwork Communication* *Packet Switching* and *Best route selectio* to the destination network.
* TCP/IP protocols defines the Two version of IP
  * IPv4: Majority in the world still use IPv4
  * IPv6: In future will replace IPv4
* IPv4 address are represented in **DDN** called *Dotted Decimal Notation* **example** *1.1.1.1*  
* In network layer term **host** refers to any device, regardless of power and size, that has an IP address and connects to any TCP/IP network

TCP/IP Network Access Layer
******************************
* This layer is also called *Link Layer* i.e. *Physical Layer* + *Data Link Layer*
* The term **link** refers to the physical connections.
* This layer defined the various protocols like,
  * WAN Standards (*PPP*, *FrameRelay*, *Ethernet*, *ATM*) and many more.
 
Data Encapsulation Process in TCP/IP Protocol Stack
********************************************************

.. image:: _static/module1/pdu.png
     
* Segment: User data + Transport Layer Header
* Packet:  Segment + IP Header
* Frame: Packet + Data Link Layer Header
* Physical layer define the data into bits, so that bits can be transmit from the transmission medium in the form of Voltage and currents.

OSI Model
----------------------------
* Open system Interconnection model, developed by ISO(International Organization for Standardization)

* Have Seven Layers. and each layers defines a set of Unique Functions.

OSI Layer Description
*************************

Application Layer:
*************************
* Provides User Interface
* Find the Communicating partner, whether it is busy or not.
* Check whether the communication medium is busy or not.


Presentation Layer
***********************
* Define Data formats like (*ASCII text EBCDIC text, binary BCD, JPEG*) 
* Data Compression and decoding is funcition.

Session Layer
***************
* Controls the Dialog between the Application
* Define the Mode of Communication (*Full Duplex, HalfDuplex,and Simple*)

Transport Layer
*******************
* Define the Process to Process Communication between the Devices.
* Error Correction Methods are defined at this layer.

Network Layer
******************
* Define Logical IP addressing.
* Node to Node communication.
* Packet Forwarding, best route Selection and internetwork Communication.
* Protocols define at this Layer is IP.

The easy way to remember OSI 7 layers is *EVERY PEOPLE SEEMS TO NEED DATA PROCESSING*
